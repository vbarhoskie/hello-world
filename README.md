# hello-world
Just another repository
I am a new learner of coding. My desire is to be a web developer and eventually a full-stack engineer. I have failed serveral times in the past to complete any projects. I am determined this time around to end that with this project. To help me succeed I have created a learning plan. I have to follow my plan systematically until I finish the course.
